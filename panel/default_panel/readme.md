# sync_ope default_panel notes

- the mounting holes fit m3 screws
- 25mm screws will fit front_panel, pcb and back_plate
- the front_panel mounts to pcb with 12mm standoffs
- will need to lie large caps and regulators down to fit panel
- blanking calibration trimpots can still be set with tool such as screwdriver
- the default potentiometers in underscores BOMs have 12mm shaft lengths - consider replacing these with >17mm shaft length alternatives if you plan to use it with a panel

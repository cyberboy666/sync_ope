- this circuit is distributed by __UNDERSCORES__ - _an open video hardware label_ : it is available to purchase - as a pcb, kit or assembled unit - at [underscores.shop](https://underscores.shop/sync_ope/)
- the schematic for the circuit can be found [here](/hardware/schematic.pdf)
- the pcb gerber files for the lastest version can be found [here](/hardware/sync_ope_latest.zip)
- consider [donating](https://liberapay.com/underscores/) to the underscores project to help us continue creating for the commons

# description



# documentation

this project is fully _open-source hardware_ - all the files required to build it are included in this repo for free. if you have the time and/or skill you can contribute back by collaborating on / testing new designs, improving these docs, making demo videos/other creative content etc. you can also support the project financially by [donating](https://liberapay.com/underscores/) directing, or purchasing through the [web shop](https://underscores.shop).

depending on whether you are going fully diy or buying an assembled and tested unit, some of the following guides will be relavent to you. the flow would be:

## ordering parts

<details><summary><b>parts sourcing guide (w/ notes on pcb fabracation )</b> - start here if you are building fully from scatch or have purchased a pcb</summary>

i try to source all the parts i can from either:
- [tayda](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/) ; cheaper for common parts like resistors etc, also good for mechanical parts like switches and buttons
- [mouser](https://www.mouser.de/) ; has lots more options, speciality video ic's, can sometimes cost more (free shipping on orders over 50euros)
- other ; ocationally there will be parts which will need to be sourced elsewhere - usually either aliexpress, ebay or amazon etc...

take a look at the [full_bom](/hardware/bom/full_bom.csv) for this project to see where i am sourcing each part from

## import into tayda

- go to the [tayda quick order](https://www.taydaelectronics.com/quick-order/) and in bottom corner choose _add from file_
- select the file [tayda_bom.csv](../hardware/bom/tayda_bom.csv) in the BOM folder (you will have to download it first or clone this repo)
- after importing select _add to cart_
- __NOTE:__ the minimum value for resistors is 10, so you may need to modify these values to add to cart (or if they are already modified here you will need to see the  full_bom for actual part QTY) 

## import into mouser

- go to [mouser bom tool](https://nz.mouser.com/Bom/) and click _upload spreadsheet_
- select the file [mouser_bom.csv](../hardware/bom/mouser_bom.csv) in this folder (you will have to download it first or clone this repo), then _upload my spreadsheet_ and _next_
- ensure that __Mouser Part Number__ is selected in the dropdown above the first row, then _next_, _process_
- if everything looks correct can now put _add to basket_

# ordering pcbs

you can support this project by buying individual pcbs from the [shop](https://underscores.shop). if you would rather have pcbs fabricated from gerbers directly the file you need is [here](/hardware/two_comparator_effect_latest.zip)

- i get my pcbs fabricated from [jlcpcb](https://cart.jlcpcb.com/quote) - 5 is the minumum order per design
- upload the zip file with the `add gerber file` button
- the default settings are mostly fine - set the __PCB Qty__ and __PCB Color__ settings (you can check that the file looks correct with pcb veiwer)
- it may be best to combine orders with other pcbs you want to have fab'd since the shipping can cost more than the items - also orginising group buys is a good way to distribute the extra pcbs /costs 
  
i often use jlcpcb because they are reliable, cheap and give you an option of colours. remember though that the cheapest Chinese fab houses are not always the most ethical or environmently friendly - if you can afford it consider supporting local companies.

## assembly guide
  
<details><summary><b>assembly guide</b> - start here if you have purchased a diy kit</summary>

## interactive BOM for build guiding

follow this link to view the [interactive BOM](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/cyberboy666/sync_ope/blob/main/hardware/bom/ibom.html)

## general solder advice

- remember to heat pad first (2-3seconds), then add solder, then continue to heat (1-2seconds)

- Checkout the web-comic [soldering is easy](https://mightyohm.com/files/soldercomic/FullSolderComic_EN.pdf) for more soldering advice

## general order of assembly

- in general while assembling i start placing resistors and capacitors first. placing 5 - 10 components at a time and then flipping the board to solder them and trim the legs etc.
- next i would do diodes, transistors and ic's - taking care that these are placed in the right direction (using a ic socket can be useful)
- finally i place the interface parts - rca jacks, power jack, pots and switches - make sure these have lots of solder on for structural stablity
